# CS-3502-W03-P2-CPUscheduling

This is an Opertaing Systems project where different CPU Scheduling algorithms are implemented and can be tested to measure their performance.

    In order to run this project, you need:
        1. .NET SDK 9.0
        2. An IDE 
        3. [OPTIONAL] RStudio (with R installed) to see the graphs created by the test program.

    To run this program, open the terminal and follow:
        1. Change the directory to cpuScheduling 
        2. Use the command: dotnet build
        3. Use the command: dotnet run

    To test this program, open the terminal and follow:
        1. Change the directory to cpuTest 
        2. Use the command: dotnet build
        3. Use the command: dotnet test

    To see the graphs with RStudio:
        1. Copy the R program provided below into RStudio
        2. Set the working directory to where the .csv file is located in this project
            (cpuTest/bin/Debug/net9.0)
        3. Highlight the entire program and click run
